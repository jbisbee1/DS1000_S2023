## Getting Set Up

Open `RStudio` and create a new RMarkDown file (`.Rmd`) by going to `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`.
Accept defaults and save this file as `[LAST NAME]_ps3.Rmd` to your `code` folder.

Copy and paste the contents of this file into your `[LAST NAME]_ps3.Rmd` file. Then change the `author: [YOUR NAME]` (line 4) to your name.

All of the following questions should be answered in this `.Rmd` file. There are code chunks with incomplete code that need to be filled in. 

This problem set is worth 10 total points, plus four extra credit points. The point values for each question are indicated in brackets below. To receive full credit, you must both have the correct code **and include a comment describing what each line does**. In addition, some questions ask you to provide a written response in addition to the code. Unlike the first two problem sets, some of the code chunks are totally empty, requiring you to try writing the code from scratch. Make sure to comment each line, explaining what it is doing!

You are free to rely on whatever resources you need to complete this problem set, including lecture notes, lecture presentations, Google, your classmates...you name it. However, the final submission must be complete by you. There are no group assignments. To submit, compiled the completed problem set and upload the PDF file to Brightspace by midnight on 2023/02/10.

**Good luck!**

## Question 0
Require `tidyverse` and load the [`nba_players_2018.Rds`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/blob/main/Lectures/4_Uni_Multivariate/data/nba_players_2018.Rds?raw=true') data to an object called `nba`. (Tip: use the `read_rds()` function with the link to the raw data.)
```{r}
#LINK: https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/blob/main/Lectures/4_Uni_Multivariate/data/nba_players_2018.Rds?raw=true')
```


## Question 1 [1 point]
Plot the distribution of points scored by all NBA players in the 2018-2019 season. Explain why you chose the visualization that you did.
```{r}
nba %>%
  ggplot() + # Put the pts variable on the x-axis of a ggplot.
   geom_...() + # Choose the appropriate geom function to visualize.
  labs(title = '', # Write a clear title explaining the plot
       subtitle = '', # Write a clear subtitle describing the data
       x = '', # Write a clear x-axis label
       y = '') # Write a clear y-axis label
```

> Write 1 to 2 sentences here.

## Question 2 [1 point]
Now recreate this plot but add two vertical lines indicating the mean and median number of points in the data. Color the median line blue and the mean line red. Why is the median lower than the mean?

```{r}
nba %>%
  ggplot() + # Put the pts variable on the x-axis of a ggplot.
   geom_...() + # Choose the appropriate geom function to visualize.
  labs(title = '', # Write a clear title explaining the plot
       subtitle = '', # Write a clear subtitle describing the data
       x = '', # Write a clear x-axis label
       y = '') + # Write a clear y-axis label
  geom_vline(xintercept = ,color = '') + # Median vertical line (blue)
  geom_vline(xintercept = ,color = '') # Mean vertical line (red)
```

> Write 1 to 2 sentences here.

## Question 3 [1 point + 1 EC]
Now visualize the distribution of the total minutes played (`minutes`). Again, justify your choice for the `geom_...` and compare the mean and median, again using blue and red lines. EC: Propose a theory for why the data looks this way.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE: Make sure to comment each line!
```

> Write 3 to 4 sentences here.

## Question 4 [1 point + 1 EC]
Now visualize the distribution of the field goal shooting percent (`pctFG`). Again, justify your choice for the `geom_...` and compare the mean and median, again using blue and red lines. EC: Propose an explanation for why this variable is **not** right-skewed, unlike the `pts` variable from Q2.

```{r}
# INSERT CODE HERE: Make sure to comment each line!
```


> Write 3 to 4 sentences here.

## Question 5 [1 point + 1 EC]
Now examine the `country` variable. Which country are most NBA players from? Visualize this variable using the appropriate `geom_...`, and justify your reason for choosing it. EC: Tweak the plot to put the country labels on the y-axis, ordered by frequency.

```{r}
# Basic Plot (NOT EC)
nba %>%
ggplot() + # Put the country variable on the x-axis of a ggplot.
   geom_...() + # Choose the appropriate geom function to visualize.
  labs(title = '', # Write a clear title explaining the plot
       subtitle = '', # Write a clear subtitle describing the data
       x = '', # Write a clear x-axis label
       y = '') # Write a clear y-axis label

# EC Plot: Insert code below and comment each line!
```

> Write 1 to 2 sentences here.

## Question 6 [3 points]
Perform a thorough univariate description of the variable `agePlayer`. Start by determining what type of measure it is (i.e., continuous, ordered categorical, etc.). Then, based on this conclusion, summarize it with either `summary()` or `count()`. Finally, visualize it. In the write-up, explain each part of this process and defend your choice of the `geom_...` used to visualize the data. Make sure to label the plot!

```{r}
# 1: Look
glimpse() # Look at the variable first

# 2: Summary statistics
# Summarize the variable with either summary() or count()

# 3: Visualize
ggplot() + # Put the agePlayer variable on the x-axis of a ggplot.
   geom_...() + # Choose the appropriate geom function to visualize.
  labs(title = '', # Write a clear title explaining the plot
       subtitle = '', # Write a clear subtitle describing the data
       x = '', # Write a clear x-axis label
       y = '') # Write a clear y-axis label
```

> Write 3 to 4 sentences here.

## Question 7 [2 points + 1 EC]
Consider the following research question: do coaches give more minutes to younger players? Hypothesize an answer to this question, and describe your thought process (theory). EC: generate a multivariate visualization that provides an answer to this question. Does the data support your hypothesis?

```{r}
# EC: INSERT CODE HERE. (Don't forget to comment and add labels!)
```
