## Getting Set Up

Open `RStudio` and create a new RMarkDown file (`.Rmd`) by going to `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`.
Accept defaults and save this file as `[LAST NAME]_ps2.Rmd` to your `code` folder.

Copy and paste the contents of this file into your `[LAST NAME]_ps2.Rmd` file. Then change the `author: [YOUR NAME]` (line 4) to your name.

All of the following questions should be answered in this `.Rmd` file. There are code chunks with incomplete code that need to be filled in. 

This problem set is worth 10 total points, plus three extra credit points. The point values for each question are indicated in brackets below. To receive full credit, you must both have the correct code **and include a comment describing what each line does**. In addition, some questions ask you to provide a written response in addition to the code.

You are free to rely on whatever resources you need to complete this problem set, including lecture notes, lecture presentations, Google, your classmates...you name it. However, the final submission must be complete by you. There are no group assignments. To submit, compiled the completed problem set and upload the PDF file to Brightspace by midnight on 2023/02/03.

**Good luck!**

## Question 0
Require `tidyverse` and load the `MI2020_ExitPoll.Rds` data to an object called `MI_raw`. (Tip: use the `read_rds()` function with the link to the raw data.)
```{r}
require()
MI_raw <- read_rds()
```


## Question 1 [1 point]
How many voters were from Wayne County? The county variable is called `County`.
```{r}
MI_raw %>%
  count() %>% # Count the number of respondents per county
  filter() # Subset to Wayne county (note capitalization)
```

> Write one or two sentences here.

## Question 2 [1 point]
Who did the majority of surveyed voters support in the 2020 presidential election? The candidate variable is `PRSMI20`.
```{r}
MI_raw %>%
  count() %>% # Count the number of respondents who supported each candidate
  mutate() %>% # Calculate this number as the proportion of all respondents
  arrange() # Arrange in decsending order
```

> Write one or two sentences here.

## Question 3 [1 point + 1 EC]
What proportion of women supported Trump? What proportion of men supported Biden? The candidate variable is `PRSMI20` and the gender variable is `SEX`. EXTRA CREDIT: Answer using `group_by()`.
```{r}
# Non-Extra Credit Approach
MI_raw %>%
  filter() %>% # Subset to women (check the numeric code!)
  count() %>% # Count the number of women who supported each candidate
  mutate() %>% # Calculate the share of women who supported each candidate
  filter() # Subset to those who supported Trump (check the numeric code!)

MI_raw %>%
  filter() %>% # Subset to men (check the numeric code!)
  count() %>% # Count the number of men who supported each candidate
  mutate() %>% # Calculate the share of men who supported each candidate
  filter() # Subset to those who supported Biden (check the numeric code!)
```

> Write one or two sentences here.


## Question 4 [1 point]
Create a new object called `MI_clean` that contains only the following variables:
  - AGE10
  - SEX
  - PARTYID
  - EDUC18
  - PRMSI20
  - QLT20
  - LGBT
  - BRNAGAIN
  - LATINOS
  - QRACEAI
  - WEIGHT
and then list which of these variables contain missing data recorded as `NA`. How many respondents were not asked certain questions?
```{r}
MI_clean <- MI_raw %>% 
  select() # Select the requested variables

summary() # Identify which have missing data recorded as NA
```

> Write one or two sentences here.

## Question 5 [1 point]
Are there **unit non-response** data in the `AGE10` variable? If so, how are they recorded? What about the `PARTYID` variable?

```{r}
MI_clean %>%
  count() # Look at the age variable to see if there is a unit-non response code

MI_clean %>%
  count() # Look at the party ID variable to see if there is a unit-non response code
```

> Write one or two sentences here.

## Question 6 [1 point]
Let's create a new variable called `preschoice` that converts `PRSMI20` to a character. To do this, install the `haven` package if you haven't already, then use the `as_factor()` function from the `haven` package combined with the `as.character()` function from base `R`. Now `count()` the number of respondents who reported voting for each candidate. Do you get the same number as in Question 2?
```{r}
MI_clean <- MI_clean %>%
  mutate() # Create new variable that converts to a character variable

MI_clean %>%
  count() # Count the number of respondents in this new variable
```

## Question 7 [1 point]
Now do the same for the `QLT20` variable, the `AGE10` variable, and the `LGBT` variable. For each variable, make the character version `Qlty` for `QLT20`, `Age` for `AGE10`, and `Lgbt_clean` for `LGBT`. 

```{r}
MI_clean <- MI_clean %>%
  mutate() # Create three new variables that convert the originals to character
```

## Question 8 [1 point]
For each of these new variables, replace the **unit non-response** label with `NA`.

```{r}
MI_clean <- MI_clean %>%
  mutate() # Replace the unit non-response codes with NA using ifelse() for all three variables.
```

## Question 9 [1 point + 1 EC]
What proportion of LGBT-identifying voters supported Trump? The candidate variable is `PRSMI20` and the LGBT variable is `Lgbt_clean` (from above). EXTRA CREDIT: Plot this answer.

```{r}
MI_clean %>%
  filter() %>% # Filter to those who identify as LGBT
  count() %>% # Count how many voted for each candidate
  mutate() # Calculate this number as a share of all LGBT
```

> Write one or two sentences here.


## Question 10 [1 point + 1 EC]
Plot the distribution of ages in the data. EXTRA CREDIT: color by the number of voters in each bracket that supported Trump, Biden, or someone else. Make sure to drop voters who didn't indicate who they voted for **AND** those who didn't indicate their age. The candidate variable is `PRSMI20` and the age variable is `Age` (from above).

```{r}
# Simple
MI_clean %>%
  ggplot() + # Set the x-axis variable of interest
  geom_bar() # Plot its distribution with a barplot
```
