## Getting Set Up

Open `RStudio` and create a new RMarkDown file (`.Rmd`) by going to `File -> New File -> R Markdown...`.
Accept defaults and save this file as `[LAST NAME]_ps7.Rmd` to your `code` folder.

Copy and paste the contents of this file into your `[LAST NAME]_ps7.Rmd` file. Then change the `author: [YOUR NAME]` (line 4) to your name.

All of the following questions should be answered in this `.Rmd` file. There are code chunks with incomplete code that need to be filled in. 

This problem set is worth 10 total points, plus three extra credit points. The point values for each question are indicated in brackets below. To receive full credit, you must both have the correct code **and include a comment describing what each line does**. In addition, some questions ask you to provide a written response in addition to the code. Furthermore, some of the code chunks are totally empty, requiring you to try writing the code from scratch. Make sure to comment each line, explaining what it is doing!

You are free to rely on whatever resources you need to complete this problem set, including lecture notes, lecture presentations, Google, your classmates...you name it. However, the final submission must be complete by you. There are no group assignments. To submit, compiled the completed problem set and upload the PDF file to Brightspace by midnight on 2023/03/31

**Good luck!**

## Question 0
Require `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` (for calculating AUC), and load the [`admit_data.rds`](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/blob/main/Lectures/7_Classification/data/admit_data.rds?raw=true') data to an object called `ad`. (Tip: use the `read_rds()` function with the link to the raw data.)
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(tidymodels)
ad <- read_rds('https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2023/blob/main/Lectures/7_Classification/data/admit_data.rds?raw=true')
```



## Question 1 [3 points]

a. Compare a linear regression (`mLM <- lm(...)`) to a logit regression (`mLG <- glm(...)`) where you predict attendance (`yield`) as a function of the following $X$ predictors:

- `distance`
- `income`
- `sat`
- `gpa`
- `visit`
- `registered`
- `legacy`
- `net_price`

Evaluate the model performance using `roc_auc` based on cross validation with 100 iterations, using an 80-20% split of the data [2 points]. 

b. Does the linear regression model or the logit perform better? [1 point]

```{r,warning = F}
set.seed(123)
# a. 
cvRes <- NULL
for(i in 1:100) {
  inds <- sample(1:nrow(ad),size = round(nrow(ad)*.8),replace = F)
  train <- ad %>% slice(inds)
  test <- ad %>% slice(-inds)
  
  # Linear
  mLM <- lm(yield ~ distance + income + sat + gpa + visit + registered + legacy + net_price,train)
  
  # Logit
  mLG <- glm(yield ~ distance + income + sat + gpa + visit + registered + legacy + net_price,family = binomial(link = 'logit'),data = train)
  
  toEval <- test %>%
    mutate(predLM = predict(mLM,newdata = test),
           predLG = predict(mLG,newdata = test,type = 'response')) %>%
    mutate(truth = factor(yield,levels = c('1','0')))

  tmpLM <- roc_auc(toEval,truth = 'truth',estimate = 'predLM') %>%
    mutate(cvInd = i,
           algo = 'LM')
  
  tmpLG <- roc_auc(toEval,truth = 'truth',estimate = 'predLG') %>%
    mutate(cvInd = i,
           algo = 'Logit')
  
  cvRes <- cvRes %>%
    bind_rows(tmpLM) %>%
    bind_rows(tmpLG)
}

# b. 
cvRes %>%
  group_by(algo) %>%
  summarise(auc = mean(.estimate))
```

> - Based on this analysis, the logistic regression model performs better, with an AUC of 0.91 versus 0.87 for the linear model.

## Question 2 [3 points]

a. Based on the result to question 1, choose the best classification algorithm and train it on the full data. [1 point]

b. Calculate the specificity and sensitivity across different thresholds ranging from zero to one, and plot these as different colored lines. [1 point]

c. What is the optimal threshold to balance the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity based on this plot? **HINT**: Use `geom_vline()` and test different `xintercept` values until you nail the intersection between the two lines. [1 point]


```{r,warning = F}
# a. 
mFinal <- glm(yield ~ distance + income + sat + gpa + visit + registered + legacy + net_price,ad,
                   family = binomial(link = 'logit'))

# b. 
ad <- ad %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,type = 'response'))

toplot <- NULL
for(thresh in seq(0,1,by = 0.025)) {
  toplot <- ad %>%
  mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > thresh,1,0)) %>%
  group_by(yield) %>%
  mutate(total_attend = n()) %>%
  group_by(yield,pred_attend,total_attend) %>%
  summarise(nStudents=n(),.groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(prop = nStudents / total_attend) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(accuracy = sum((yield == pred_attend)*nStudents) / sum(nStudents)) %>%
  mutate(threshold = thresh) %>%
    bind_rows(toplot)
}

toplot %>%
  mutate(metric = ifelse(yield == 1 & pred_attend == 1,'Sensitivity',
                         ifelse(yield == 0 & pred_attend == 0,'Specificity',NA))) %>%
  drop_na(metric) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = threshold,y = prop,color = metric)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,by = .05)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = .615) + # c.
  labs(title = 'Sensitivity and Specificity by Threshold',
       subtitle = 'Model: Linear Regression',
       x = 'Threshold',
       y = 'Proportion Correct',
       color = 'Metric')
```

> - The optimal threshold is 0.615. This threshold value maximizes both sensitivity and specificity of the model.

## Question 3 [4 points]

a. How many students with SAT scores higher than 1300 are currently enrolled (`yield`)? How many students with SAT scores higher than 1300 are predicted to enroll according to our model? [1 point]

b. What is the average SAT score and total tuition among enrolled students? [1 point]

c. Reduce the net price (`net_price`) for students with SAT scores higher than 1300 by $5,000. How many are now estimated to enroll? [1 point]

d. What is the average SAT score among students predicted to enroll after adjusting the `net_price`? What is the total tuition? [1 point]


```{r}
# a. 314 high SAT students currently enrolled.
ad %>%
  count(yield,sat > 1300)

# 328 high SAT students predicted to enroll.
ad %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,type = 'response')) %>%
  mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > .615,1,0)) %>%
  count(pred_attend,sat > 1300)

# b. 
ad %>%
  filter(yield == 1) %>%
  summarise(avgSAT = mean(sat,na.rm=T),
            tuition = sum(net_price,na.rm=T))

# c.
hypo <- ad %>%
  mutate(net_price = ifelse(sat > 1300,net_price - 5000,net_price))

hypo %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,newdata = hypo,type = 'response')) %>%
  mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > .615,1,0)) %>%
  count(pred_attend,sat > 1300)

# d. 
hypo %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,newdata = hypo,type = 'response')) %>%
  mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > .615,1,0)) %>%
  filter(pred_attend == 1) %>%
  summarise(avgSAT = mean(sat,na.rm=T),
            tuition = sum(net_price,na.rm=T))
```

a. There are 314 students currently enrolled with SAT scores higher than 1300. Our model predicts that there should be 328 students enrolled who have SAT scores higher than 1300.
b. The average SAT score is roughly 1226, and the total tuition is $30.7m.
c. After adjusting the price, the model predicts that 332 students with SAT scores greater than 1300 will enroll.
d. After adjusting the price, the model predicts that the average SAT score will be 1239 and the total tuition will be $25.4m.

## Extra Credit [3 points]

a. How high can you increase the average SAT score while maintaining current revenues, using only the `net_price` to induce changes? [1 point]

b. Answer this question using a loop. [1 point]

c. How does your answer change if you restrict the final `net_price` value per observation to be no lower than zero, and no higher than $45,000? [1 point]


```{r}
# a.
hypo <- ad %>%
  mutate(net_price = ifelse(sat >= 1300,0,45000))

hypo %>%
  mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,newdata = hypo,type = 'response')) %>%
  mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > .615,1,0)) %>%
  filter(pred_attend == 1) %>%
  summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat),
            revenues = sum(net_price),
            nStudents = n())

# b. 
toplot <- NULL
for(i in c(2500,5000,7500,10000,15000,20000,25000)) {
  for(j in c(2500,5000,7500,10000,15000,20000,25000)) {
    for(realistic in c(TRUE,FALSE)) { # c. 
        hypo <- ad %>%
          mutate(net_price = ifelse(sat >= 1300,net_price - i,net_price + j))
      
        # c. 
        if(realistic) {
                 hypo <- hypo %>%
                    mutate(net_price = ifelse(net_price < 0,0,
                                    ifelse(net_price > 45000,45000,net_price)))
        }
      
        toplot <- hypo %>%
          mutate(preds = predict(mFinal,newdata = hypo,type = 'response')) %>%
          mutate(pred_attend = ifelse(preds > .615,1,0)) %>%
          filter(pred_attend == 1) %>%
          summarise(mean_sat = mean(sat),
                    revenues = sum(net_price),
                    nStudents = n()) %>%
          ungroup() %>%
          mutate(aid = i,
                 charge = j,
                 realistic = realistic) %>%
          bind_rows(toplot)

    }
  }
}

toplot %>%
  filter(charge == 25000)

# b. 
toplot %>%
  filter(!realistic) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(aid),y = factor(charge),fill = mean_sat)) + 
  geom_tile()

toplot %>%
  filter(!realistic) %>%
  filter(revenues >= 30674149) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_sat))

# c. 
toplot %>%
  filter(realistic) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(aid),y = factor(charge),fill = mean_sat)) + 
  geom_tile()

toplot %>%
  filter(realistic) %>%
  filter(revenues >= 30674149) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_sat))
```

a. I can achieve an average SAT score of 1254 while maintaining revenues above $3.07m if I reduce `net_price` by $20,000 for students with SAT scores greater than or equal to 1300, and charging those with SAT scores lower than 1300 an additional $25,000.

c. If I restrict `net_price` to be realistic values (i.e., never going lower than zero and never greater than the maximum tuition of $45,000), I can only improve average SAT scores to 1239 which is achieved by charging students with scores less than 1300 an additional $15,000 and incentivizing those with scores 1300 or greater with any amount of money.
